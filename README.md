# Reservoir-characterization
 Artificial Intelligence techniques have been used in petroleum engineering to predict various properties such as porosity, permeability, water saturation.. 
 The most extensively used among these is Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). 
 This project presents a study of application of ANN in the prediction of porosity and permeability of oil and gas reservoirs. 
 A dataset obtained from oil reservoir  in a geographical location is used for training, testing and validation of the model. 
 In the heterogeneous reservoirs classical methods face problems in determining the relevant petrophysical parameters accurately. 
 Applications of artificial Intelligence have recently made this challenge turn into a possible practice . 
 The objective of this project was to develop  an accurate reservoir  description with the aid of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) utilizing available geophysical well log data.
